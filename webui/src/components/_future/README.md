# Future / Unimplemented Components

Components here are preserved for future implementation. They are **not** imported or used by the app.

## Contents

- **MultiResolutionFusion.tsx** – UI for multi-resolution data fusion. Requires backend fusion API (`/api/v1/fusion/*`). To enable: mount `marshab._future.fusion_routes` in api.py, then import and use this component where needed.
